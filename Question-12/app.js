//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

var names = [
    "Haseeb",
    "Haris",
    "Anas",
    "Kareem",
];
console.log("Hi ".concat(names[0], ", Would you like to learn some TypeScript today"));
console.log("Hi ".concat(names[1], ", Would you like to learn some TypeScript today"));
console.log("Hi ".concat(names[2], ", Would you like to learn some TypeScript today"));
console.log("Hi ".concat(names[3], ", Would you like to learn some TypeScript today"));
